##APP Summary
Welcome to the 'Martial Arts Styles & Schools Page'. You can use it to create and maintain all different Martial Arts Styles and their prominent schools.

##Technologies Used
* AJAX to perform RESTful service request to, and receive data back from the backend
* Express API to build the backend service
* Mongo DB is used to store the information in database
* Github for version control

##Features
User can create entry for each Martial Arts Style. Each style entry contains the following information:
* style type(name)
* description

* a link to reference information of the style
* a list of their prominent schools

While each of the schools have the following informations:
* school name

##Planned Features
* Validation to make sure it does not allow the same style to be added more than once
* Validation to make sure the same school is not added to the same style more than once
